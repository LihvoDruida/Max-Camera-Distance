**Max Camera Distance** is the ultimate camera utility for World of Warcraft. It unlocks the hidden potential of the game engine, allowing you to zoom out further than the standard UI slider permits, giving you a massive advantage in raids, dungeons, and PvP.

Whether you are a Raider needing to see boss mechanics, a PvP player watching for flankers, or an Explorer enjoying the view, this addon handles it all automatically.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Smart Zoom System (Context-Aware)
The addon intelligently changes your camera distance based on what you are doing:
* **Combat Mode:** Automatically zooms out to the absolute maximum when you enter combat for better situational awareness.
* **Mount & Travel Mode:** Detects when you mount up or use travel forms (Druid Flight/Travel form, Shaman Ghost Wolf, Evoker Soar, etc.) and adjusts the camera for travel.
* **Peace Mode:** Returns to a closer, more immersive "Normal" distance when you leave combat or dismount.
* **Smooth Transitions:** No jarring jumps! The camera smoothly glides between distances. You can customize the transition speed in options.

### ⚙️ Advanced Camera Control
* **Break the Limit:** Extends camera distance beyond default limits (up to 39 yards in Retail / 50 yards in Classic).
* **Unexpected Movement Protection:** Minimizes the annoying camera "jumps" when your character collides with walls or terrain (Smart Pivot).
* **Terrain Collision (Indirect Visibility)::** Option to allow the camera to clip through objects for a consistent view.
* **Zoom Speed:** Customize how fast the mouse wheel zooms in and out.

### 🛠️ Quality of Life & Performance
* **Always Sharpen (FSR):** Forces the game to apply FidelityFX sharpness for a crisper image, even without upscaling enabled.
* **Soft Target Icons:** Enables interaction icons over NPCs, portals, and objects.
* **Quest Tracker Cleaner:** Includes a button to instantly untrack all quests to reduce UI clutter and boost FPS in raids.
